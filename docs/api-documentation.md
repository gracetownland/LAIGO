## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using AWS Cognito JWT tokens. The token must be included in the `Authorization` header of each request.

---

### Obtaining a Token

Users authenticate through AWS Cognito and receive an ID token. This token is used for all API requests.

```javascript
// JavaScript example using AWS Amplify
import { fetchAuthSession } from "aws-amplify/auth";

const session = await fetchAuthSession();
const token = session.tokens?.idToken?.toString();
```

---

### Authorization Levels

The API uses role-based access control (RBAC) with three authorization levels. Each authorizer validates that the user has the specific role in the database:

- **Admin**: User must have `admin` role in database to access `/admin/*` endpoints
- **Instructor**: User must have `instructor` role in database to access `/instructor/*` endpoints
- **Student**: User must have `student` role in database to access `/student/*` endpoints (with some shared endpoint exceptions)

**Important:** Users must explicitly have the role attached to access endpoints. Having an `admin` role does NOT automatically grant access to `/instructor/*` or `/student/*` endpoints - the user must also have those specific roles in their database record.

## Base URL

```
https://{api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/prod
```

Replace `{api-id}` and `{region}` with your API Gateway deployment values.

## Common Headers

All requests should include:

```
Authorization: {cognito-id-token}
Content-Type: application/json
```


## Error Responses

### Standard Error Format

```json
{
  "error": "Error message description"
}
```

---

### HTTP Status Codes

- `200` - Success
- `400` - Bad Request (invalid parameters or request body)
- `401` - Unauthorized (missing or invalid token)
- `403` - Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- `404` - Not Found (resource doesn't exist)
- `429` - Too Many Requests (rate limit exceeded)
- `500` - Internal Server Error

---

# Student Endpoints

Student endpoints require the user to have the `student` role in the database. The student authorizer validates this role before allowing access to most `/student/*` endpoints.

**Shared Endpoints:** Some student endpoints are accessible to any authenticated user regardless of role:
- `GET /student/profile`
- `GET /student/role_labels`
- `GET /student/get_disclaimer`
- `POST /student/accept_disclaimer`

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting at multiple levels:

---

### WAF Rate Limiting

- **Per IP**: 2000 requests per 5 minutes
- **Per User**: 200 requests per 5 minutes (based on Authorization header)

---

### Application Rate Limiting

- **Daily Message Limit**: Configurable per-user daily message limit (default: 50 messages)
  - Applies to AI chat interactions
  - Returns `429 Too Many Requests` when exceeded
  - Resets daily at midnight UTC

---

### Best Practices

- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Cache responses when appropriate
- Use WebSocket for real-time streaming instead of polling
- Monitor rate limit headers in responses

## Security Considerations

### Token Management

- ID tokens expire after 1 hour
- Use refresh tokens to obtain new ID tokens
- Never expose tokens in logs or client-side code
- Store tokens securely (use AWS Amplify for automatic secure storage)

---

### CORS

All endpoints support CORS with the following headers:
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: *`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key`

---

### Security Headers

All responses include security headers:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none';`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`

---

### Input Validation

- All request bodies are validated against schemas
- Query parameters are type-checked
- File uploads are validated for size and type
- PII detection via AWS Bedrock Guardrails

## WebSocket API

For real-time streaming AI responses, notifications, and bidirectional communication, use the WebSocket API. See the [WebSocket Implementation Guide](.kiro/steering/Websocket.md) for detailed documentation.

**WebSocket URL:**
```
wss://{websocket-api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/prod
```

**Key Features:**
- Real-time AI chat streaming
- Progress assessment with streaming feedback
- Summary generation with streaming output
- Audio transcription status updates
- Real-time notifications


## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

#### 401 Unauthorized

**Cause:** Missing or invalid JWT token

**Solution:**
- Verify token is included in `Authorization` header
- Check token hasn't expired (1 hour lifetime)
- Refresh token using AWS Amplify

```javascript
import { fetchAuthSession } from "aws-amplify/auth";

const session = await fetchAuthSession({ forceRefresh: true });
const token = session.tokens?.idToken?.toString();
```

#### 403 Forbidden

**Cause:** User doesn't have the required role in the database

**Solution:**
- Verify user has the specific role required for the endpoint in the database
- Admin endpoints require `admin` role
- Instructor endpoints require `instructor` role
- Student endpoints require `student` role (except shared endpoints)
- Note: Having `admin` role does NOT automatically grant access to instructor or student endpoints
- Use `/admin/user_role` endpoint to add required roles to users

#### 404 Not Found

**Cause:** Resource doesn't exist or user doesn't have access

**Solution:**
- Verify resource ID is correct
- Check user owns the resource (for student endpoints)
- Verify instructor-student relationship (for instructor endpoints)

#### 429 Too Many Requests

**Cause:** Rate limit exceeded

**Solution:**
- Implement exponential backoff
- Check daily message limit hasn't been reached
- Wait before retrying

```javascript
async function fetchWithRetry(url, options, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    const response = await fetch(url, options);
    
    if (response.status === 429) {
      const delay = Math.pow(2, i) * 1000; // Exponential backoff
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
      continue;
    }
    
    return response;
  }
  throw new Error("Max retries exceeded");
}
```

#### 500 Internal Server Error

**Cause:** Server-side error

**Solution:**
- Check CloudWatch logs for detailed error information
- Verify request body matches expected schema
- Contact system administrator if issue persists

---

### Debugging Tips

1. **Enable verbose logging:**
```javascript
// Log all requests and responses
const originalFetch = window.fetch;
window.fetch = async (...args) => {
  console.log("Request:", args);
  const response = await originalFetch(...args);
  console.log("Response:", response.status, await response.clone().text());
  return response;
};
```

2. **Validate request bodies:**
```javascript
// Ensure all required fields are present
const validateCaseCreation = (data) => {
  const required = ["case_title", "case_type", "jurisdiction", "case_description", "province", "statute"];
  const missing = required.filter(field => !data[field]);
  if (missing.length > 0) {
    throw new Error(`Missing required fields: ${missing.join(", ")}`);
  }
};
```

3. **Check token expiration:**
```javascript
import { jwtDecode } from "jwt-decode";

const isTokenExpired = (token) => {
  const decoded = jwtDecode(token);
  return decoded.exp * 1000 < Date.now();
};
```

## API Best Practices

### Performance

1. **Use pagination** for list endpoints to reduce response size
2. **Cache responses** when data doesn't change frequently (e.g., role labels, disclaimers)
3. **Use WebSocket** for real-time features instead of polling REST endpoints
4. **Batch operations** when possible to reduce number of requests

---

### Error Handling

1. **Always check response status** before parsing JSON
2. **Implement retry logic** with exponential backoff for transient errors
3. **Log errors** with context for debugging
4. **Provide user-friendly error messages** in the UI

```javascript
async function apiRequest(url, options) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, options);
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      const error = await response.json();
      throw new Error(error.error || `HTTP ${response.status}`);
    }
    
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("API request failed:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

---

### Security

1. **Never log tokens** or sensitive data
2. **Validate input** on client-side before sending to API
3. **Use HTTPS** for all requests
4. **Implement CSRF protection** for state-changing operations
5. **Sanitize user input** to prevent XSS attacks
