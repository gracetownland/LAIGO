# User Disable / Removal Guide

This guide documents two distinct user-management workflows in LAIGO. Because there is no built-in admin UI for these actions, the process requires manual Cognito and/or SQL steps.

- Workflow A: Disable user access (blocks sign-in, keeps all data).
- Workflow B: Fully remove a user (permanently deletes database data and Cognito identity).

Choose only one workflow based on your goal.

## Prerequisites

- For **Workflow A (Disable access)**:
  - Amazon Cognito permissions to disable/enable users in the User Pool

- For **Workflow B (Full removal)**:
  - Amazon SageMaker AI permissions (to create a notebook instance in the VPC)
  - Amazon Cognito permissions (to delete users from the User Pool)
  - AWS Secrets Manager permissions (to retrieve database credentials from the console)

- The user's email address or `cognito_id` (UUID)

## Overview

- **Workflow A (Disable access)**
  - Best for: temporary suspension, investigations, or when records must remain intact
  - Result: user cannot sign in; database data is unchanged

- **Workflow B (Full removal)**
  - Best for: permanent account removal and data cleanup
  - Result: user data is deleted from PostgreSQL and user is deleted from Cognito

For full removal, user data lives in two places and both must be cleaned:

1. **PostgreSQL (RDS)** — the `users` table and all related records across multiple tables
2. **AWS Cognito** — the user's authentication identity and group membership

---

## Workflow A: Disable User Access (No Data Deletion)

Use this workflow when you only need to block app access.

1. Open the **AWS Console** and navigate to **Amazon Cognito**
2. Select the LAIGO User Pool (named `{StackPrefix}-ApiStack-pool` or similar)

3. Go to **Users** and click on the username of the desired user

4. CLick on **Actions** and select  **Disable user access**

### Verify disable status

- In Cognito, the user status should show as disabled.
- The user should no longer be able to authenticate.

### Re-enabling Users
- To re-enable the user, repeat the above steps and select **Enable user access** instead.
---

## Workflow B: Fully Remove User (Permanent)

Use this workflow only when permanent deletion is required.

### Step 1: Connect to the Database via SageMaker AI

The RDS instance runs inside an isolated VPC with no public access. Use a SageMaker AI notebook instance to connect.

#### 1a. Create a Notebook Instance

- Open the **AWS Console** and navigate to **Amazon SageMaker AI** > **Notebooks** > **Notebook instances**
- Click **Create notebook instance**
- Give it a name (e.g., `laigo-db-admin`)

![Create Notebook](./media/create-notebook-instance.png)

#### 1b. Select the VPC

- Under **Network**, select the LAIGO VPC (the one created by the `VpcStack`)

![Select VPC](./media/select-vpc.png)

#### 1c. Select the Subnet

- Choose one of the **private subnets** (labeled `private-subnet-1` in the VPC). Do not use the isolated subnets — the notebook needs internet access to install Python packages via pip.

![Select Subnet](./media/private-subnet.png)

#### 1d. Select the Security Group

- For the security group, select the **RDS database's security group** (not the default VPC security group). You can find it in the AWS Console under **RDS** > **Databases** > select your instance > **Connectivity & security** > **VPC security groups**. It will be named something like `DatabaseStack-database-SecurityGroup-XXXX`. Using this same security group ensures the notebook can reach the RDS Proxy without any additional rules.

#### 1e. Connect to the Database

- Once the notebook instance is running, click **Open Jupyter** and create a new **Python 3** notebook (New > conda_python3).

Each code block below is a separate notebook cell. Copy and paste them in order.

**Cell 1 — Install psycopg2:**

```python
!pip install psycopg2-binary
```

**Cell 2 — Import libraries:**

```python
import psycopg2
```

**Cell 3 — Enter database credentials:**

Retrieve the credentials from the AWS Console:
1. **RDS Proxy endpoint**: Navigate to **RDS** > **Proxies** > select your proxy > copy the **Proxy endpoint** (looks like `xxxxx-proxy.proxy-xxxxx.region.rds.amazonaws.com`)
2. **Username and password**: Navigate to **Secrets Manager** > search for `{StackPrefix}-LAIGO/credentials/rdsDbCredential` > click **Retrieve secret value** > copy the `username` and `password`

```python
DB_HOST = ""      # <-- Paste the RDS Proxy endpoint from RDS Proxies
DB_PORT = ""      # <-- Paste the port from Secrets Manager
DB_NAME = ""      # <-- Paste the dbname from Secrets Manager
DB_USER = ""      # <-- Paste the username from Secrets Manager
DB_PASS = ""      # <-- Paste the password from Secrets Manager
```

**Cell 4 — Connect to the database:**

> The RDS Proxy requires TLS, so `sslmode='require'` is mandatory.

```python
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host=DB_HOST,
    port=DB_PORT,
    dbname=DB_NAME,
    user=DB_USER,
    password=DB_PASS,
    sslmode="require",
)
conn.autocommit = False
cur = conn.cursor()
print("Connected successfully")
```

---

### Step 2: Identify the User

**Cell 5 — Look up the user by email:**

> Replace `user@example.com` with the actual email address.

```python
USER_EMAIL = "user@example.com"  # <-- CHANGE THIS

cur.execute("""
    SELECT user_id, idp_id, user_email, first_name, last_name, roles
    FROM users
    WHERE user_email = %s;
""", (USER_EMAIL,))

user = cur.fetchone()
if user:
    USER_ID = str(user[0])
    print(f"Found user: {user[2]} ({user[3]} {user[4]})")
    print(f"user_id: {USER_ID}")
    print(f"idp_id (cognito): {user[1]}")
    print(f"roles: {user[5]}")
else:
    print("User not found. Check the email address.")
    USER_ID = None
```

---

### Step 3: Delete User Data from PostgreSQL

The tables must be cleaned in the correct order to respect foreign key constraints. Some tables use `ON DELETE CASCADE` from the `cases` table, but the user's direct references need explicit deletion.

**Cell 6 — Delete all user data (run as a transaction):**

> This uses the `USER_ID` variable from Cell 5. Make sure it printed a valid user before running this.

```python
assert USER_ID is not None, "No user found — go back to Cell 5"

try:
    # 1. Delete annotations authored by this user
    cur.execute('DELETE FROM annotations WHERE author_id = %s;', (USER_ID,))

    # 2. Delete case feedback authored by this user
    cur.execute('DELETE FROM case_feedback WHERE author_id = %s;', (USER_ID,))

    # 3. Delete messages sent by this user (as instructor)
    cur.execute('DELETE FROM messages WHERE instructor_id = %s;', (USER_ID,))

    # 4. Delete case reviewer assignments
    cur.execute('DELETE FROM case_reviewers WHERE reviewer_id = %s;', (USER_ID,))

    # 5. Delete instructor-student relationships
    cur.execute('DELETE FROM instructor_students WHERE instructor_id = %s OR student_id = %s;', (USER_ID, USER_ID))

    # 6. Delete cases owned by this user
    #    (cascades to: case_feedback, summaries, annotations, audio_files, messages linked by case_id)
    cur.execute('DELETE FROM cases WHERE student_id = %s;', (USER_ID,))

    # 7. Remove authorship from prompt versions (keeps the prompts, nullifies author)
    cur.execute('UPDATE prompt_versions SET author_id = NULL WHERE author_id = %s;', (USER_ID,))

    # 8. Remove authorship from disclaimers
    cur.execute('UPDATE disclaimers SET author_id = NULL WHERE author_id = %s;', (USER_ID,))

    # 9. Remove updated_by from role_labels
    cur.execute('UPDATE role_labels SET updated_by = NULL WHERE updated_by = %s;', (USER_ID,))

    # 10. Delete the user record
    cur.execute('DELETE FROM users WHERE user_id = %s;', (USER_ID,))

    conn.commit()
    print(f"Successfully deleted all data for user {USER_ID}")

except Exception as e:
    conn.rollback()
    print(f"Error — transaction rolled back: {e}")
```

> Steps 7-9 nullify the `author_id`/`updated_by` rather than deleting the records, since prompts and disclaimers are shared system resources. If you want to delete them entirely, replace the `UPDATE` lines with `DELETE FROM` statements.

**Cell 7 — Verify deletion:**

```python
cur.execute('SELECT count(*) FROM users WHERE user_id = %s;', (USER_ID,))
print(f"Users remaining: {cur.fetchone()[0]}")  # Should be 0

cur.execute('SELECT count(*) FROM cases WHERE student_id = %s;', (USER_ID,))
print(f"Cases remaining: {cur.fetchone()[0]}")  # Should be 0
```

**Cell 8 — Close the connection:**

```python
cur.close()
conn.close()
print("Connection closed")
```

---

### Step 4: Remove the User from Cognito

1. Open the **AWS Console** and navigate to **Amazon Cognito**
2. Select the LAIGO User Pool (named `{StackPrefix}-ApiStack-pool` or similar)
3. Go to **Users** and search for the user by email
4. Select the user and click **Delete user**

---

## Important Notes

- Do not run Workflow A and Workflow B as a single sequence unless you explicitly intend to fully remove the user after a temporary disable period.
- Workflow A is reversible (`admin-enable-user`).
- Workflow B is irreversible and should follow your retention/compliance policies.
