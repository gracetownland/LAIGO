### Manage Users Page

The first user that signs up will automatically be assigned an administrator role. Upon logging in as an administrator, they will see the following home page where they can view all the users in the application, their names, emails, and highest privilege role. Administrators can browse for specific users using the searchbar, or filter to view certain roles using the role dropdown menu.:

#### Signup Access

The Signup Access tab allows administrators to control whether the application allows anyone to sign up, or only certain emails can sign up. Administrators can toggle public signup on and off, and upload a csv whitelist formatted as "email,role" to allow specific users to sign up.

The Prompt Workspace allows administrators to:

Advocates can click on a case and see the overview, summaries, transcriptions, notes as well as interact with the AI Assistant.

### New Case Page

### Case Page

Upon creating a new case, users will be redirected to the Case Overview panel. Here, they can see the details of their case, edit the case title & description, and also submit the case for a review to an available supervisor by selecting their name and clicking "Submit for Review":

The Interview Assistant panel is where users can interact with the AI. The main panel is where users can ask questions and receive responses. A progress bar is shown above to indicate the thoroughness of the user's analysis, and a feedback panel on the right-hand side continuously updates with suggestions for improvement.

A Guide icon is available in the header (top-right). Clicking it opens a help dialog that explains what the progress bar represents, how the feedback panel works, and what the system expects as you explore different parts of the case.

The Interview Assistant is divided into 4 stages, each focusing on a different aspect of case analysis:

1. **Intake & Facts** — Gather and organize the key facts of the case. The AI helps you identify relevant details, clarify the timeline, and ensure nothing important is missed.
2. **Legal Analysis** — Identify legal issues, research applicable law, and build your arguments. This stage combines issue spotting, research strategy, and argument construction into a single workflow.
3. **Contrarian Analysis** — Explore counterarguments and weaknesses in your position. The AI challenges your reasoning to help you prepare for opposing perspectives.
4. **Policy Context** — Consider the broader policy implications and societal context surrounding the case, helping you understand how your arguments fit within larger legal and social frameworks.

Each stage has its own progress bar. As you interact with the AI and demonstrate thorough analysis, the progress bar fills up. Once a stage is complete, the next stage unlocks automatically.

Upon interacting with the AI Assistant, the advocate can choose to generate a downloadable summary pdf of the information and insights from the LLM by clicking on the "Generate Summary" button below the AI message. This button then generates a downloadable pdf version of a summary which is viewable from the "Case Summaries" page:

- Users may also generate a full case summary by generating individual summaries across the 4 stages first, then clicking "Generate Full Case Summary".

The advocate can also navigate to the "Case Transcriptions" tab to upload audio and transcribe. Click on the "Upload Audio" button to upload an audio file, and when done, Transcriptions will be viewable and downloadable in the main page.

The user can also click on the Notepad button in the bottom left corner, which opens up a resizable and movable yellow legal pad where the user can note significant details of the particular case:
