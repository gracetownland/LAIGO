## Architecture

1. **Edge and security** – All incoming traffic passes through **AWS Shield**, **Amazon CloudFront**, and **AWS WAF** to provide Layer 3, 4, and 7 protection. This layer flags potential threats, manages rate-limiting, and ensures secure content delivery before requests reach the application.

2. **Frontend** – The React web application is hosted and deployed via **AWS Amplify**. **AWS Cognito** serves as the authentication provider, managing user sign-up, sign-in, and secure access control to the backend services.

3. **API layer** – The backend surface is managed by **Amazon API Gateway**, which handles two primary communication patterns:
    - A **REST API** endpoint that routes CRUD operations and requests for pre-signed URLs to backend Lambda functions.
    - A **WebSocket API** (Streaming) that facilitates real-time, low-latency communication for chat interactions and live updates.

4. **Audio processing workflow** – When a user initiates an audio upload:
    1. A pre-signed URL is generated when the user uploads an audio file.
    2. The pre-signed URL is stored in an **Amazon S3** bucket.
    3. An **AWS Lambda** function monitors the bucket, retrieves the audio file, and prepares it for transcription processing.
    4. **Amazon Transcribe** processes the uploaded audio file and converts it into text.

5. **Data persistence** – Meta data related to the audio file and its transcription, such as timestamps and case id, alongside primary application data, including such as cases and users, is stored in an **Amazon RDS SQL Database**. An **AWS RDS Proxy** is utilized to manage a high volume of concurrent connections efficiently and improve database scalability.


6. **Notifications** – **Amazon EventBridge** receives domain events and routes them to a **Notification Service Lambda**, which stores notification and connection state data in **DynamoDB**.

7. **Standard CRUD endpoints** – The **Amazon API Gateway REST API** exposes standard CRUD endpoints for core resources (for example, users, cases, feedback, and summaries) through role-aware Lambda handlers.

8. **AI services** – For intelligent text generation, summarization, and related assessments, dedicated Lambda functions retrieve context from persistence layers and invoke **Amazon Bedrock** models.

9. **Notifications and AI streaming to frontend** – The backend pushes real-time notification and AI generation updates to the frontend through the **Amazon API Gateway WebSocket API**, enabling low-latency status and response streaming.

10. **Infrastructure & CI/CD pipeline** – The backend uses **AWS CodePipeline** and **AWS CodeBuild** to automate build and deployment workflows, with container images stored in **Amazon ECR** for Lambda-based services.
